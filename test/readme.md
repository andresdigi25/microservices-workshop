# Tests Automation Overview

üê¶ **JMeter**: Apache JMeter is an open-source Java-based tool for load testing, performance testing, and functional testing of web applications. It allows simulating heavy loads on a server, network, or object to test its strength and analyze overall performance under different load types.

üñ•Ô∏è **Selenium**: Selenium is a widely used open-source tool for automating web browsers. It provides a portable framework for testing web applications and supports various programming languages. Selenium is commonly used for automating web-based administration tasks and tests.

üöÄ **Postman**: Postman is a collaboration platform for API development. It allows users to design, mock, test, document, and monitor APIs with ease. Postman simplifies the process of testing APIs by providing a user-friendly interface to make requests and validate responses.

This repository combines the power of JMeter, Selenium, and Postman to provide a comprehensive suite for automated testing, performance monitoring, and API testing, ensuring the reliability and scalability of web applications.
